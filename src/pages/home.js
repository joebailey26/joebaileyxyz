								<h1>Iâ€™m Joe, a Full Stack Web Developer.</h1>
								<h5 className="description">My passion for web development has always been present both prior to, and at College and University. As a result, I have gained experience in a variety of areas. This includes developing bespoke WordPress sites, creating PWA's, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sites, and working with clients. During the second year of my University course I plan to learn as much as possible, whilst working with as many different types of clients as possible before I undertake a 12-month placement in Web Development.</h5>
